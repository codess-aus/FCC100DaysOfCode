/*
Basic Algorithm Scripting: Slice and Splice
You are given two arrays and an index.

Use the array methods slice and splice to copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.

Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.

Return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.

***

Problem Explanation
We need to copy each element from the first array into the second array starting at the index n. Weâ€™ve also got to ensure that the original arrays are not mutated. That is, we cannot make any changes to the original arrays.

Code Explanation
Our goal is to take all of the elements from arr1 and insert them into arr2 starting with index position n. At the same time we must ensurethat neither arr or arr2 have been mutated.

Using the slice() function we can create an exact replica of arr2 and assign the result of the operation to a variable, localArray.

Now that we have an array that we can mutate on, we can iterate through every item in the first array. For each item in the first array we can use the splice() function to insert the item into index n of localArray.

We increment the index n by one. This will ensure that every item from the arr1 is inserted into localArray in the proper index position.

Finally, we return the localArray and end the function.

function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {
    let localArray = arr2.slice();
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
      localArray.splice(n, 0, arr1[i]);
      n++;
    }
  return localArray;
  }
  frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1);
