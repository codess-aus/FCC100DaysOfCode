# FCC100DaysOfCode
Code completed following FreeCodeCamp

So I'm rebooting my #100DaysOfCode I've decided to do the @freeCodeCamp course from the start. 
It has 3000 hours of content and I'm about halfway through the Basic HTML section on #Day001

#Day002 #100DaysOfCode 23 out of 28 lessons into the HTML part. 
@freeCodeCamp
 is a really fun way to learn. It won't let you move on until you pass the test so you can't just read it, you have to really understand it. Definitely a practical way for me to learn
 
 #Day003 #100DaysOfCode continued to learn to use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes. It requires some thinking about
 
#Day004 #100DaysOfCode finished the HTML and HTML5 section.  
Bonus, I sat my MS900 exam today and passed it, so I think this hour was sprinkles on the donut

#day005 #100daysofcode 
Moved onto the CSS section and started playing with colours and fonts.

#Day006 #100daysofcode
I definitely don't remember having this much fun when I first learnt to code at Uni. But now, it's a bunch of puzzles I get to solve and I'm loving it!

#Day007 #100DaysOfCode
My updates might be a bit less frequent, I'm going on holidays and we don't have internet in the place where we stay. I know... what kind of place doesn't have internet? It must be cold and dark indeed!

#Day008 and #Dat009 #100DaysOfCode
Finished the CSS section of 
@freeCodeCamp Love this cute penguin. CSS is pretty flexible and fun

#Day010 #100daysOfCode - I'm almost 20% through the Applied Visual Design section. What I love is that everything seems like a puzzle to solve. And I know I can solve it. I'm not scared and confused like I was when I first learnt to code - I can see the patterns in what I'm doing

#Day011 #100DaysOfCode 50% through the Applied Visual Design Section. #CSS is fun. It all makes so much sense, and like #Python it doesn't care too much about white space. Coding is so much easier to read these days, with the syntax highlighting and being able to choose colour

#Day012 #100DaysOfCode I'm about 75% of the way through this section. Sometimes the code hints aren't there, and as you can't move on unless you solve it, it forces me to think extra hard for what it wants. But it makes sense. It's not so baffling. After a little bit I get it :-)

#Day013 #100DaysOfCode Finished the Applied Visual Design course and started the Applied Accessibility one. All goes well. I'm using the ThalysNet as we travel from Amsterdam to Brussels.

#Day014 #100DaysOfCode Now 50% through Applied Accessibility. Who knew we were supposed to be giving meaning to our words with the layout itself!?? Loving the semantic meaning section. Sooooooo much to think about!

#Day015 #100DaysOfCode Finished the Applied Accessibility section. This is so cool.

Completed the Responsive Web Design Challenges #Day016 #100DaysOfCode Previously I'd been guessing with how to correctly size images on web pages. It's great to finally understand how to do that properly.

#Day017 #100DaysOfCode Happy Xmas everyone 
Started & completed the CSS Flexbox section. 1st thing I did on Xmas morning, after #PokemonGo striking a lucky egg, opening all my pokepals gifts and evolving some pokemon was do my code. No better way to start the day

As I was on @Amys_Kapers favourite topic, I pushed through and did the whole thing for my #day018 #100DaysOfCode And she is right #CSSGrid really is magic! Can't wait to start building stuff using these cool tricks
