# FCC100DaysOfCode
Code completed following FreeCodeCamp

So I'm rebooting my #100DaysOfCode I've decided to do the @freeCodeCamp course from the start. 
It has 3000 hours of content and I'm about halfway through the Basic HTML section on #Day001

#Day002 #100DaysOfCode 23 out of 28 lessons into the HTML part. 
@freeCodeCamp
 is a really fun way to learn. It won't let you move on until you pass the test so you can't just read it, you have to really understand it. Definitely a practical way for me to learn
 
 #Day003 #100DaysOfCode continued to learn to use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes. It requires some thinking about
 
#Day004 #100DaysOfCode finished the HTML and HTML5 section.  
Bonus, I sat my MS900 exam today and passed it, so I think this hour was sprinkles on the donut

#day005 #100daysofcode 
Moved onto the CSS section and started playing with colours and fonts.

#Day006 #100daysofcode
I definitely don't remember having this much fun when I first learnt to code at Uni. But now, it's a bunch of puzzles I get to solve and I'm loving it!

#Day007 #100DaysOfCode
My updates might be a bit less frequent, I'm going on holidays and we don't have internet in the place where we stay. I know... what kind of place doesn't have internet? It must be cold and dark indeed!

#Day008 and #Dat009 #100DaysOfCode
Finished the CSS section of 
@freeCodeCamp Love this cute penguin. CSS is pretty flexible and fun

#Day010 #100daysOfCode - I'm almost 20% through the Applied Visual Design section. What I love is that everything seems like a puzzle to solve. And I know I can solve it. I'm not scared and confused like I was when I first learnt to code - I can see the patterns in what I'm doing

#Day011 #100DaysOfCode 50% through the Applied Visual Design Section. #CSS is fun. It all makes so much sense, and like #Python it doesn't care too much about white space. Coding is so much easier to read these days, with the syntax highlighting and being able to choose colour

#Day012 #100DaysOfCode I'm about 75% of the way through this section. Sometimes the code hints aren't there, and as you can't move on unless you solve it, it forces me to think extra hard for what it wants. But it makes sense. It's not so baffling. After a little bit I get it :-)

#Day013 #100DaysOfCode Finished the Applied Visual Design course and started the Applied Accessibility one. All goes well. I'm using the ThalysNet as we travel from Amsterdam to Brussels.

#Day014 #100DaysOfCode Now 50% through Applied Accessibility. Who knew we were supposed to be giving meaning to our words with the layout itself!?? Loving the semantic meaning section. Sooooooo much to think about!

#Day015 #100DaysOfCode Finished the Applied Accessibility section. This is so cool.

Completed the Responsive Web Design Challenges #Day016 #100DaysOfCode Previously I'd been guessing with how to correctly size images on web pages. It's great to finally understand how to do that properly.

#Day017 #100DaysOfCode Happy Xmas everyone 
Started & completed the CSS Flexbox section. 1st thing I did on Xmas morning, after #PokemonGo striking a lucky egg, opening all my pokepals gifts and evolving some pokemon was do my code. No better way to start the day

As I was on @Amys_Kapers favourite topic, I pushed through and did the whole thing for my #day018 #100DaysOfCode And she is right #CSSGrid really is magic! Can't wait to start building stuff using these cool tricks

I also started the Responsive Web Design Projects section and made my first Codepen
https://codepen.io/msandfor/details/qBEjgjv

#Day019 and #Day020 40% of the way through the Responsive Web Design Projects section using Codepen to create a survey form today https://codepen.io/msandfor/full/jOELwyp it used up all my data. Totally worth it #100DaysOfCode

#Day021 60% of the way through the Responsive Web Design Projects section using codepen. In fairness, this one is a mess and I need to spend more time on cleaning up this page. But dataplan is almost gone. Will have to wait to hols end #100daysofcode

https://codepen.io/msandfor/full/gObxjdX

#Day022 80% of the way through the Responsive Web Design Projects section. This one looks better, I like the template, but probably want to play with it a bit more when I'm back home. This whole section would be good for building stuff. #100DaysOfCode

https://codepen.io/msandfor/full/gObGPGd

#Day023 Completed the Responsive Web Design Projects section. That's the first 300 hours of #100DaysOfCode - there is stuff I want to go back and make better when I have more data available to me - but I'm excited about what I'm building

https://codepen.io/msandfor/full/povWyzb

#Day024 #100DaysOfCode Started and got through 20% of the #Javascript section. This is good. I enjoy #JS it makes sense to me

#Day025 #100DaysOfCode Got 30% of the way through the #Javascript section. Gotta hurry - I'm mentoring for @MCJSPerth on Saturday, so I'll need to know my shit

#Day026 #100DaysOfCode 40% of the way through the #JS section. I was pretty tired tonight but managed to stay focused for the hour it took because it's pretty clear to me. I can tell when looking at it when it's not right. The CSS and HTML was harder for me.

#Day027 #100DaysOfCode 47% of the way through JS, can't do anymore... waaaay too tired and it's 3 mins to midnight.

Think I might finally be getting back in the right timezone, fell asleep at the right time last night and only woke up for one meal at 3am, then slept again. So this is yesterdays code for #day028 #100daysofcode I'll do some more tonight

#Day029 #100DaysOfCode - went through all the lessons for tomorrows @MCJSPerth to check I know what the right solutions are. Nearly had a heart attack when thinking I might have merged to the master branch. Realised I hadn't. Completed everything - very pleased with myself 

Day030 #100DaysOfCode - spent the day mentoring for #MusesCodeJS Saw people collaborating, understanding the problem in different ways, producing code that was different than mine, yet still worked (sometimes worked better). Heard concepts explained in different ways. Great day 

Day031 #100DaysOfCode I'm 70% of the way through the #Javascript section. This is both addictive and relaxing. I spent most of the day on this (apart from the awesome nap I had) and I feel really relaxed. Off to walk the dogs and play some #pokemonGo now as a reward :-) 

#Day032 #100DaysOfCode working on Accessing Object Properties with Variables which is making my brain hurt. I always had difficulties with Objects in coding, it's like a mental block. But I'm determined not to let it stop me this time

#Day033 #100DaysOfCode getting near the end of the #javascript section. Some bits are easy to me, other bits still require significant squinting at the screen, but I'm happy with my progress. Gotta keep going and I'll get better every day 

#Day034 #100DaysOfCode hosted #FendersPerth and saw some great talks, did a bit of #javascript on loops before going home

#Day035 #100DaysOfCode nearly finished the basic #javascript section. I like the stuff on loops.

#Day036 #100DaysOfCode started day at #GCFPDay then when to #FringeWorld to see #STEM #Climate session. Then topped off the day by finishing the basic #javascript section on #FreeCodeCamp - I am very tired now

#Day037 #100DaysOfCode started the ES6 section on #FreeCodeCamp got 10% of the way through. I guess we don't use var anymore then...

#day038 #100DaysOfCode 19% of the way through the ES6 section. 

#Day039 #100DaysOfCode Today I went from "what the hell?" to "well yeah, obvi I'd write it that way. Less is more, right?" I definitely couldn't do this yet without the guidance, but I could read it and pick out what's wrong if someone else coded it. That's progress right?

#Day040 #100daysofcode My brain hurts! "Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence." Helen Keller

#Day041 had an indescribable yearning to do #Github #LearningLabs today for a bit of a break from front end stuff... I do love the way a bot talks you through the courses. Great way to learn.

#Day042 #100DaysOfCode Even my #FreeCodeCamp seems to be celebrating #LunarNewYear

#Day043 #100daysofcode Some days everything just makes sense. Finished the ES6 section and while yesterday baffled me, today was super easy. I think the topics were more relatable to me, not just that I do better in the morning.

#Day044 #100DaysOfCode Started regular express #regex in #Javascript I'm 15% through. I'm enjoying this part because it's easy for me to grasp. Is that shallow? I enjoy the stuff I find easy? Nah... I like it when it seems like a puzzle too. Just not when it's incomprehensible

#Day045 #100DaysOfCode started going through the #Django workshop for #SheCodes mentoring on Saturday. I mentor in #Python but I want to be able to help with the #Django too. Did a little #github contribution, made the pull request and all before 7am. 

#day046 Gonna count mentoring in #Python as today's #100DaysOfCode as we were then from 9am till 4pm and I got tested on my python, django and Windows knowledge by these super keen #womenWhoCode at #SheCodes

#Day047 #100DaysOfCode 27% of the way through the #Regex section. Love it.

#Day048 #100DaysOfCode 42% of the way through this section. Wanted to get this done in the morning before the busy week starts. 

#Day049 #100DaysOfCode loved checked the caboose was behind them 52% done

#Day50 #100DaysofCode Got up to the "Restrict possible usernames" task and stopped, this one looks super interesting so want to think about it more before I just push out some code on instinct. Will come back to it later.

#Day051 #100DaysOfCode had a lot of fun with the pattern matching section. Not quite finished, but I'm too tired to keep going. Looking forward to the weekend when I can do a few uninterrupted hours.

#Day052 #100DaysOfCode Finished the #regex section which is good, I don't have to remember all those letters and symbols do I ?

let wsRegex = /^\s+|\s+$/g;

Next onto debugging!

Day053 #100DaysOfCode Loved Loved Loved the debugging section. I thought it was gonna be some mysterious toolset that would explain the magical ways people debug code. Instead it was pretty much just me looking at code and solving the errors. I do love solving puzzles

#Day054 #100DaysOfCode popping, shifting, unshifting and splicing. Fun ways to amend arrays. The more you do this stuff, the more sense it makes. I do like #javascript … I mean, it's not #python but it's still super fun and makes sense to me

#Day055 #100DaysOfCode did some more #Javascript on spread operators, then switched to #codecombat for a while, just for funsies.

#Day056 #100DaysOfCode Tried to do some multi-dimensional arrays, but my tired brain could not grasp the problem, never mind formulate the answer. So I went back to #CodeCombat to solve some puzzles in #Javascript instead of #Python - turns out it's exactly the same at the start

#Day057 #100DaysOfCode Accessed some Property Names with Bracket Notation. I would like some fruit now...

#Day058 #100DaysOfCode Finished the basic data structures section of #FreeCodeCamp Last night I put fruit into arrays, and it made me want fruit. Today I was sorting friends...

#Day059 #100DaysOfCode my tired brain was finding it hard going, so I decided to go back to basics. I reset my #CodeCombat progress (yes I wiped everything), and started again in #Javascript Realised two things:

1. Going through things now I am familiar with the concepts means I can go through at a much faster pace, and slow down when the concept is less clear to me.
2. #Python and #Javascript have a lot of stuff in common and the learnings for one make it easier for me to get the other

#day060 #100daysofcode did about 20 levels of codecombat tonight. It's really quick when you know what you're doing 

#Day061 Finished Kithgard Dungeon and did 9 levels of Backwoods Forest. I definitely took way longer to work through this the first time. Being familiar with the concepts makes everything much easier... and so much quicker. And better.

#Day062 did a bunch of code combat levels, and then looked at factorials on freecodecamp.

#day063 #100daysofcode went to #SheCodes for a casual #hackday and worked on some #Microsoft #botframework stuff in #python Always more fun when you get to code with people you love being around Purple heart❤Blue heartYellow heartGreen heart❤Orange heartYellow heartRevolving hearts

#day064 #100daysofcode went to learn the #GirlsProgrammingNetwork #python tutorials at ECU today. Next week we get to teach it to 14 year olds.

#Day065 #100DaysOfCode Finished going through all the content for building the Secret Diary Chatbot for the #GirlsProgrammingNetwork That was really fun. I learn so much better when incentivized by the idea of teaching others how to learn.

#Day066 #100daysofcode George tells me I should solve algorithms by breaking them down into each component part. Write out the sudo code and then what I am doing will be clearer. George is often right.

#day067 #100daysofcode spent the day helping girls aged 10 to 16 code a bot in #python

#Day068 #100DaysOfCode went back to my #javascript course and continued with algorithms. Currently I can't see a day when I'd remember these methods without looking them up... but I remember a day when I couldn't read and understand them, so I guess I just need to have faith

#Day069 #100DaysOfCode Did a bunch more #javascript algorithms. Going to do some #AI stuff now

#Day070 I've reached the part I've been dreading... I definitely did not like #OOP the first time round. However, I'm ready to give it another go. #FreeCodeCamp is a really good teacher, surely I can get my head round it now #100DaysOfCode

#day071 #100DaysOfCode It was a #Microsoft Learning Day today so Steven Payne taught a bunch of us Coding with the #MinecraftEdu - you can use #Python or #Javascript or logic blocks. I also did a couple of hours building intelligent bots on the #AIschool

#Day072 #100DaysOfCode Today was one of those days when I spent so long in the code that my #doggos came and demanded I leave the screen and come walk, eat or anything but code. C# is fussy hey? But Visual Studio has a lot of stuff to fix all those complaints. Building Bots again

#Day073 #100DaysOfCode - I have been through this tutorial 3 times and I still don't know what's wrong with the code. I have always had a mental block around #OOP and C# is an incomprehensible language to me, but I was really focused today and I still can't fix it :-(

    @mattyjward gave me the fix on the twitter:
    I'm thinking you might have a file named echobotold that is also defining a class named echobot and thoroughly confusing the compiler. I'd comment out that whole file

    I renamed echobotold.cs to echobot.old and it worked :-D

#Day074 #100DaysOfCode - Okay, I know I always say how much I hate #OOP but this morning I started the #FreeCodeCamp chapters on it, and I got 30% of the way through before work and it was pretty fun. I'll try to remain optimistic that as it gets harder it will get even more fun 

#Day075 #100DaysOfCode Was talking to Eliza earlier... things got dark very quickly. I wrote my first one of these in #Prolog when I was doing my Masters in CompSci. Looking at it in #Python today #TuringTest #ChatBot #Python

#Day076 #100DaysOfCode 62% of the way through the #OOP section on #FreeCodeCamp - it's actually more enjoyable than I remember. Think I might be able to get into it after all.

#Day077 #100DaysOfCode Having me struggling through the #AISchool #CognitiveBots tutorials. C# is definitely not my thing. But have been getting some help from the twitterverse so it's been cool. And frustrating. And interesting... I think

#Day078 did some more bot stuff. Researching. Reading. A bit a #Python coding, but nothing significant. Should be in a good position for tomorrow though.

Day079 #100DaysOfCode Finished the #OOP section on #FreeCodeCamp while mentoring for #SheCodes on #Python FYI - We used #MSTeams for my mentoring group chat not the alternative

I had to do some more #Javascript just to calm myself down. I'm in the #FunctionalProgramming Section of #FreeCodeCamp It was talking about cups of tea, which is naturally calming to someone who comes from the UK #100daysofcode #Day080

Day081 #100DaysOfCode Did a couple more functional programming sections today, then worked on my bots talk for #DevTalks

#Day082 #100DaysOfCode Played with a #python bot that can tell if a twitter account is a bot or not. Lots of research towards my #DevTalks talk.

#Day083 #100DaysOfCode Started Amy's Front End Workshop, that she is doing for #NDCOslo - in my mind we were going to be doing #Javascript but of course it was #HTML and #CSS - enjoyed learning with George and Jia as my virtual classmates 

#Day084 #100DaysOfCode Continued with Amy's Day 2 FrontEnd Workshop, with Jia as the other student. Was really good today. We moved a lot quicker, but we were also asking lots of questions. Jia thinks of different things than I do, so I learnt a lot of stuff. 

#Day085 #100dayofcode Learning #accessibility today on Amy Kapernicks Front End Fundamentals workshop. Jia and Snickers are studying with us.

@Day086 #100DaysOfCode Been doing more Bot Framework stuff this week. Trying to follow the whole process from end-to-end adding Q&A Maker, LUIS, ChitChat, Project Personality Chat, Translator Text, Image detection, Multi-Lingual etc...

Been slowed down by subscription issues and account errors, which is slowing me down. But it's cool stuff - so much is there to build with, just a matter of planning what to do with it all - and then doing it.

Figured out what was wrong with the LUIS authoring with the help of a nice Microsoft engineer from Europe. Finished the bot, it works perfectly locally but not in the Web App Test from Azure. Nothing wrong with the code, just some stupid integration thing #Day087 #100DaysOfCode

#Day088 #100DaysOfCode Day the final day of Amy's Front-End Fundamentals workshop. We did Testing today.

#Day089 #100DaysOfCode Back into the FreeCodeCamp Functional Programming stuff. Brain is definitely slow after not practicing this for a while.

#day090 #100DaysOfCode OK - back into the #Javascript Functional Programming. Complexity is 6... so time to do something, if only I knew what.
