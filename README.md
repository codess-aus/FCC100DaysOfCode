# FCC100DaysOfCode
Code completed following FreeCodeCamp

So I'm rebooting my #100DaysOfCode I've decided to do the @freeCodeCamp course from the start. 
It has 3000 hours of content and I'm about halfway through the Basic HTML section on #Day001

#Day002 #100DaysOfCode 23 out of 28 lessons into the HTML part. 
@freeCodeCamp
 is a really fun way to learn. It won't let you move on until you pass the test so you can't just read it, you have to really understand it. Definitely a practical way for me to learn
 
 #Day003 #100DaysOfCode continued to learn to use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes. It requires some thinking about
 
#Day004 #100DaysOfCode finished the HTML and HTML5 section.  
Bonus, I sat my MS900 exam today and passed it, so I think this hour was sprinkles on the donut

#day005 #100daysofcode 
Moved onto the CSS section and started playing with colours and fonts.

#Day006 #100daysofcode
I definitely don't remember having this much fun when I first learnt to code at Uni. But now, it's a bunch of puzzles I get to solve and I'm loving it!

#Day007 #100DaysOfCode
My updates might be a bit less frequent, I'm going on holidays and we don't have internet in the place where we stay. I know... what kind of place doesn't have internet? It must be cold and dark indeed!

#Day008 and #Dat009 #100DaysOfCode
Finished the CSS section of 
@freeCodeCamp Love this cute penguin. CSS is pretty flexible and fun

#Day010 #100daysOfCode - I'm almost 20% through the Applied Visual Design section. What I love is that everything seems like a puzzle to solve. And I know I can solve it. I'm not scared and confused like I was when I first learnt to code - I can see the patterns in what I'm doing

#Day011 #100DaysOfCode 50% through the Applied Visual Design Section. #CSS is fun. It all makes so much sense, and like #Python it doesn't care too much about white space. Coding is so much easier to read these days, with the syntax highlighting and being able to choose colour

#Day012 #100DaysOfCode I'm about 75% of the way through this section. Sometimes the code hints aren't there, and as you can't move on unless you solve it, it forces me to think extra hard for what it wants. But it makes sense. It's not so baffling. After a little bit I get it :-)

#Day013 #100DaysOfCode Finished the Applied Visual Design course and started the Applied Accessibility one. All goes well. I'm using the ThalysNet as we travel from Amsterdam to Brussels.

#Day014 #100DaysOfCode Now 50% through Applied Accessibility. Who knew we were supposed to be giving meaning to our words with the layout itself!?? Loving the semantic meaning section. Sooooooo much to think about!

#Day015 #100DaysOfCode Finished the Applied Accessibility section. This is so cool.

Completed the Responsive Web Design Challenges #Day016 #100DaysOfCode Previously I'd been guessing with how to correctly size images on web pages. It's great to finally understand how to do that properly.

#Day017 #100DaysOfCode Happy Xmas everyone 
Started & completed the CSS Flexbox section. 1st thing I did on Xmas morning, after #PokemonGo striking a lucky egg, opening all my pokepals gifts and evolving some pokemon was do my code. No better way to start the day

As I was on @Amys_Kapers favourite topic, I pushed through and did the whole thing for my #day018 #100DaysOfCode And she is right #CSSGrid really is magic! Can't wait to start building stuff using these cool tricks

I also started the Responsive Web Design Projects section and made my first Codepen

#Day019 and #Day020 40% of the way through the Responsive Web Design Projects section using Codepen to create a survey form today https://codepen.io/msandfor/full/jOELwyp it used up all my data. Totally worth it #100DaysOfCode

#Day021 60% of the way through the Responsive Web Design Projects section using codepen. In fairness, this one is a mess and I need to spend more time on cleaning up this page. But dataplan is almost gone. Will have to wait to hols end #100daysofcode

https://codepen.io/msandfor/full/gObxjdX

#Day022 80% of the way through the Responsive Web Design Projects section. This one looks better, I like the template, but probably want to play with it a bit more when I'm back home. This whole section would be good for building stuff. #100DaysOfCode

https://codepen.io/msandfor/full/gObGPGd

#Day023 Completed the Responsive Web Design Projects section. That's the first 300 hours of #100DaysOfCode - there is stuff I want to go back and make better when I have more data available to me - but I'm excited about what I'm building

#Day024 #100DaysOfCode Started and got through 20% of the #Javascript section. This is good. I enjoy #JS it makes sense to me

#Day025 #100DaysOfCode Got 30% of the way through the #Javascript section. Gotta hurry - I'm mentoring for @MCJSPerth on Saturday, so I'll need to know my shit

#Day026 #100DaysOfCode 40% of the way through the #JS section. I was pretty tired tonight but managed to stay focused for the hour it took because it's pretty clear to me. I can tell when looking at it when it's not right. The CSS and HTML was harder for me.

#Day027 #100DaysOfCode 47% of the way through JS, can't do anymore... waaaay too tired and it's 3 mins to midnight.

Think I might finally be getting back in the right timezone, fell asleep at the right time last night and only woke up for one meal at 3am, then slept again. So this is yesterdays code for #day028 #100daysofcode I'll do some more tonight

#Day029 #100DaysOfCode - went through all the lessons for tomorrows @MCJSPerth to check I know what the right solutions are. Nearly had a heart attack when thinking I might have merged to the master branch. Realised I hadn't. Completed everything - very pleased with myself 

Day030 #100DaysOfCode - spent the day mentoring for #MusesCodeJS Saw people collaborating, understanding the problem in different ways, producing code that was different than mine, yet still worked (sometimes worked better). Heard concepts explained in different ways. Great day 

Day031 #100DaysOfCode I'm 70% of the way through the #Javascript section. This is both addictive and relaxing. I spent most of the day on this (apart from the awesome nap I had) and I feel really relaxed. Off to walk the dogs and play some #pokemonGo now as a reward :-) 

#Day032 #100DaysOfCode working on Accessing Object Properties with Variables which is making my brain hurt. I always had difficulties with Objects in coding, it's like a mental block. But I'm determined not to let it stop me this time

#Day033 #100DaysOfCode getting near the end of the #javascript section. Some bits are easy to me, other bits still require significant squinting at the screen, but I'm happy with my progress. Gotta keep going and I'll get better every day
