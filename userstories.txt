Common templates[edit]
User stories may follow one of several formats or templates. 
The most common would be the Connextra template:
As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>

Chris Matts suggested that "hunting the value" was the first step in successfully delivering software, and proposed this alternative:

In order to <receive benefit> as a <role>, I can <goal/desire>

Elias Weldemichael, on the other hand, suggested the "so that" clause is perhaps optional although still often helpful:

As a <role>, I can <goal/desire>, so that <why>

Another template based on the Five Ws specifies:
As <who> <when> <where>, I <want> because <why>
