        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
        Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it 
        very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue 
        language to connect existing components together.
      </p>

      <p>
        The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:


      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Beautiful is better than ugly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explicit is better than implicit.
        </li>
        <li>
        Simple is better than complex.
        </li>
        <li>
        Complex is better than complicated.
        </li>
        <li>
        Readability counts.

      <p>
        Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. 
        In contrast to Perl's "there is more than one way to do it" motto, Python embraces a "there should be one—and preferably 
        only one—obvious way to do it" design philosophy.[54] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and 
        Python book author, writes that "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. 
        This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. 
        Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his 
        frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach
      </p>
      <p>
        An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British 
        comedy group Monty Python[57]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer 
        to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar. A common neologism in the Python community is 
        pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python 
        idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on 
        readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is 
        called unpythonic. Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas.

  <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
    <header>Hello world</header>
    <article>
      To get started with writing Python, open visual studio code and write your
      first "Hello world" Python code:
      <code
        >print('Hello, world!');
      </code>

      Right click the code in the editor and run it in your terminal.

  <section class="main-section" id="Syntax">
    <header>Syntax</header>
    <p>
      Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords 
      where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and 
      semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; 
      a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic 
      structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation doesn't have any 
      semantic meaning. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
      You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
      identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
      _name.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Methods">
    <header>Methods</header>
    <article>
      Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, 
      syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, 
      in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages
      <p>
        Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, 
        operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, 
        Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than 
        silently attempting to make sense of them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. 
        New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are 
        instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
        can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
        below.
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Libraries">

    <article>
      <p>
        Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. 
        For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules 
        for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with 
        arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref 
        follows PEP 333), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites (if supplied). 
        However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. 
      </p>
      <code>
      n = int(input('Type a number, then its factorial will be printed: '))

        if n < 0:
        raise ValueError('You must enter a positive number')

        fact = 1
        i = 2
        while i <= n:
            fact = fact * i
            i += 1
        print(fact)
</code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>

      <code
        >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
        defined</code

  <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
    <header>Global variables</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
        pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
        variables using the window.variable syntax.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
        frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
        name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
        document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
        parent.phoneNumber.
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
    <header>Constants</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
        syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
        identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
        can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
      </p>

      <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
      <p>
        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
        while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
        variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
        represent a variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
        variable in the same scope. For example:
      </p>

      <code
        >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
        }</code
      >
      However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
      is executed without problems.
      <code
        >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code
      >

  <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
    <header>Data types</header>
    <article>
      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li>
              null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
              is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
              other variant.
            </li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>
              Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
              unique and immutable.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
      Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
      to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
      are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
      objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
      your application can perform.

  <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
    <header>if...else statement</header>
    <article>
      Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
      true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
      is false. An if statement looks as follows:

      <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
      condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
      Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
      condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
      statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
      including further nested if statements.
      <p>
        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
        conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
      </p>
      <code
        >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
      </code>
      In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
      evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
      them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
      to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

      <code
        >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
      >
      It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
      because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
      the code. For example, do not use the following code:
      <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
      assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
      additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

      <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
    <header>while statement</header>
    <article>
      A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
      evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

      <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
      statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
      statement following the loop.

      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while.
      </p>

      <p>
        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
        those statements.
      </p>

      Example:

      <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

      <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
      <p>
        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
        Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
        true, so the loop terminates.
      </p>

  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
    <header>Function declarations</header>
    <article>
      A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
      statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

      <ul>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>
          A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
          separated by commas.
        </li>
        <li>
          The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
          brackets, { }.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
      </p>

      <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
      <p>
        The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
        consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
        function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
        specifies the value returned by the function.
      </p>
      <code>return number * number;</code>
      <p>
        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
        value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
        the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
        the calling function.
